Young programmer in the process of learning. 

I want to pursue red teaming/ethical hacking/pentesting, so software development is not my end goal. 

Making simple quality of life automation scripts, POC malware, or just making funny one off projects will make up the majority of this profile.

Maybe once im more experienced, I'll contribute to open sourced projects I find intersting.

My learning progress will also be shared here, more info about me will be shared along the way.

Thanks for showing interest
