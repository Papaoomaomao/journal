Hey guys, first update.

I've built my first mini project. Its a simple script that solves the quadrtatic formula with three numbers of your choice.

I've already learned alot from the project.

1. Making a project shouldn't be though as one big task. All programming is, is working towards one goal by solving smaller problems one by one. 
2. Programming is intimidating, but for some reason, grasping what modules are and what "import" is made it easier. I knew the concept of coding/developing/programming,
but I didnt understand how it exactly interacted with your machine, but import opened my eyes.
3. Python is easy

Also, Christmas is coming up, so that means gifts.

I've been wanting to get a Raspberry Pi for wifi hacking for a while, but I'm conflicted. Theres this guy names Zyvhur, and he makes awesome Raspberry Pi projects and I want
to buy one, but its kind of expensive. Plus, I dont get a keyboard or a 32g micro-ssd. What concerns me more though, is that I might not be able to upgrade the Pi when I need
to because its in a 3d printed case. Honestly, with a Raspberry Pi, buying a kit would only be a little less than if I commissioned it. Plus, it will look badass with the monitor
mode wifi adapter. Fuck it, I deserve it. Im getting it.

Im not sure what else I'm getting, but the next thing I want is a Bash Bunny/Rubber Ducky. I'll buy an arduino and make it myself, not only will this be my first REAL and REWARDING
project, but also it will help me sleep at night knowing the price of the Pi was offset with me saving money on other tools.

This Pi is a must for me, I need to get experience with Linux. Specifically Kali Linux.

Oh and also, after im confident enough in Python, I'll probably learn Bash, Go, or Rust and then learn C++ and JavaScript
