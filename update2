Hey guys, small update on where my head space is at right now.

I've been thinking about making a cryptocurrency for my longterm goal. I'm not sure what goes into it, but I am a little intimidated. Informations sticks and holds
with me very well though, so learning about blockchains and stuff shouldn't take very long. This Raspberry Pi stuff has also inspired me with other projects involving hardware. 
I know its illegal, but I want to set up a bulletproof hosting server and let people rent it out for some extra cash. I am very criminal minded, which is one of the reasons why 
I want to work in the field I do. Not because I WANT to commit crimes, but because I have no moral issue with doing it, and I'm good at it. 

The reason why I'm even into this stuff in the first place was because of my mischief.

From 6th grade to maybe like my sophmore year, I played on this Minecraft server. It wasn't any normal server, but it was an anarchy server, that mean't absolutely no rules or
regulations. I did not find this server on accident, I was actually searching for a server to do whatever I pleased. Obviously, the worst of the worst kind of people were there. 
However, this experience made me a very, very good social engineer. I was always very intelligent since a young age, and this server gave me an outlet for that. Now, I am one of 
the richest people on the server, and I have the biggest stash by volume. I'm rambling, but my point is that im adept at exploiting people, and that combined with little morals 
made me very successful. 

During my time on the server however. I met alot of very tech savvy people. People that knew how to code, and finish projects from start to finish. I think this was my gateway into
hacking/proggramming. I hope to God that those were my script kiddie days and now they're over.
